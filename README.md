# Machine learning with JavaScript

This is a very basic intro to machine learning and neural networks using [Brain.js](https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js?files=1) which is a machine learning library for JavaScript.

### What is a neural network? 
A neural network can be viewed as a human brain that has many connected artifical neurons that are stacked into layers. In the image below, "input", "hidden" and "output" can be seen as layers. Data 
moves through them in a single direction: Data->Input->Hidden->Output. This allows alllows deep learning to occur, we can feed it 
vast amount of data and it can be trained to interpret the data and make predictions by anaylizing "training sets" or "training data".

The larger the data set, the more accurate the predictions will be. This example provides 2 sets of training data. Run `node index.js` or `node index2.js` to run your data against the network. 
You can manipulate the training data in the following files: `data.json` & `index.js`
